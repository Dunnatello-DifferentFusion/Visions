### Project Objective
Our goal for this project was to design a video game in the Unity game engine featuring weapon physics simulation & game AI programming for our Advanced Game & Simulation Development course project.

This project involved game design, level design, weapon physics simulation, and a light focus on game AI (the AI just follows the player around using the NavMesh).

Our main objective was to simulate gun physics in a game, which we achieved in this project by following tutorials and prototyping our own systems.

## Visions
The game, <i>Visions</i>, is a FPS zombie shooter taking place in a futuristic dystopian city. Originally, we were intending to make a multiplayer 5v5 competitive movement shooter, but we discovered how difficult that would be to implement pretty quickly and pivoted to a more reasonable course project.

## Level Design
The game features an endless wave shooter that will continously spawn zombies until the player dies. Players can use the level design to outsmart the zombie opponents in order to survive longer.

<b>Why are the zombies dancing?</b>
The real question is: why not? Honestly, at the time, we did not have much experience with creating animations, so we used free animations included in the character package. However, we know about the ample amount of free animations available online now.

## Conclusions And Lessons Learned
### Weapon Physics & Handling
While making this game, we learned how game weapons work and how to simulate projectile based weapons accurately.
